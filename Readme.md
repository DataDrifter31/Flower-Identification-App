## 🔮 Model Information

This app uses a Core ML model trained to recognize various types of flowers. Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the model file is not included in the repository. You can:

- Train your own model using Create ML
- Download pre-trained models from Apple's Core ML Model Gallery
- Contact the developer for the specific model used in this project
